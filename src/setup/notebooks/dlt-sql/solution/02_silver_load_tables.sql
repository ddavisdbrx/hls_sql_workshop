-- MAGIC ###Patient Claims
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC The patient claims fact table will source from two sources, inpatient claims and outpatient claims.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC In this scenario we are assuming that both of these sources is "insert only", meaning that there will be no updates or deletes to the source records. This allows for a streaming table to be created. As the data comes from two sources, we are able to use a [flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dlt/flows) to load from two seperate queries.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC If the sources could be modified, then it would be more approprate to create a materialized view instead of the table. This materialized fiew would have been a union query of the two sources. This is the most realistic "real world" example of how to do this. We are including this example do display how a flow will work.
